            I have always been fascinated by the world of science and
            technology. That's why I studied a Bachelor of Engineering -BE,
            Electrical and Electronics Engineering. While I was studying, I
            worked as a hospital administrative assistant, which inspired me to
            pursue a Master of Science â€“ MS, Bioengineering and Biomedical
            Engineering. There I learnt to manage genomic databases, programming
            in R, Matlab and Python. In my thesis I worked with Arduino and
            thanks that I discovered the fascinating world of 3D printing. Later
            I learnt about Robotics, Machine Learning and Artificial
            Intelligence.

            I worked as a freelance web developer, using HTML, CSS, JS and React
            on the front-end and Node.js on the back-end. Currently I am still
            learning to be Web3 engineer, Blockchain with Solidity. I am really
            excited about the change that is taking place and I would like to be
            able to contribute with the knowledge that I have been acquiring
            during these years, and why not, be part of the change.
